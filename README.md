## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Research and plan
/research "WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events"
/create-adr "real-time communication strategy"

# 2. Create comprehensive specification
/create-spec "real-time chat system"

# 3. Implement with TDD

## 📁 Directory Structure

After installation, Code Captain creates an organized workspace:

```
.code-captain/
├── commands/            # All available commands
├── docs/               # Generated documentation
├── research/           # Technical research reports
├── decision-records/   # Architecture Decision Records
├── specs/              # Feature specifications
└── cc.md              # Complete reference guide
```

Plus IDE-specific integration files in:

- `.cursor/rules/` (Cursor)
- `.github/` (Copilot)
- `.claude/` (Claude.dev)

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Setup

Each development environment has its own setup process and command syntax:

| Platform       | Installation Location | Command Format | Documentation                             |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Cursor**     | `.cursor/commands/`   | `/command`     | [Cursor Guide](cursor/README.md)          |
| **Copilot**    | `.github/`            | `/command`     | [Copilot Guide](copilot/README.md)        |
| **Claude.dev** | `.claude/`            | `/command`     | [Claude.dev Guide](claude-code/README.md) |
