# Create ADR Workflow

## Overview
Create comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that systematically document architectural decisions with clear rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences through structured analysis and review process.

## When to Use
- Making significant architectural decisions affecting system structure
- Documenting technology choices with vendor lock-in or high switching costs
- Recording decisions contrary to team expectations or industry standards
- Capturing complex trade-offs between competing approaches
- Establishing architectural patterns and standards for team consistency

## Prerequisites

**MANDATORY:** This workflow automatically executes research if no relevant research exists.

Process:
1. Check for existing research on the decision topic
2. If no research found: **automatically execute** complete research workflow
3. Only proceed with ADR creation after research is completed

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Check for Existing Research and Auto-Execute if Missing

Use `find_by_name` to search for related research:
```bash
find .code-captain/research -name "*[topic]*" -type f
```

Use `list_dir` to explore research directory structure.

If no relevant research found:
```
‚ùå No existing research found for this architectural decision.

üîÑ AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTING RESEARCH WORKFLOW FIRST...

Reading .code-captain/commands/research.md and executing complete research process...
```

**Execute research workflow automatically:**
- Use `view_file` to read research workflow documentation
- Execute 4-phase research methodology:
  - Phase 1: Define Research Scope
  - Phase 2: Initial Discovery  
  - Phase 3: Deep Dive Analysis
  - Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendations
- Use `write_to_file` to create research document
- **ONLY CONTINUE** with ADR creation after research is completed

### Step 2: Analyze Decision Context and Current State

**Analysis Actions:**

1. **Understand current architectural patterns:**
   - Use `codebase_search` with queries:
     - "What architectural patterns are currently in use?"
     - "How are similar decisions handled in the codebase?"
     - "What dependencies and integrations exist?"

2. **Find existing ADRs:**
   - Use `find_by_name` to locate existing ADRs in `.code-captain/decision-records/`
   - Use `list_dir` to explore system structure

3. **Gather decision context:**
   - Identify decision stakeholders and concerns
   - Determine specific decision needed and urgency
   - Document current architectural context

### Step 3: Define Decision Scope and Criteria

**Actions:**
1. Define the specific architectural decision requiring documentation
2. Identify driving forces and constraints:
   - Business requirements and goals
   - Technical constraints and limitations
   - Performance, security, scalability requirements
   - Team skills and organizational capabilities
   - Timeline and budget constraints
3. Establish decision criteria and priorities
4. Determine decision maker(s) and approval process
5. Set boundaries for decision scope

### Step 4: Research Alternatives and Evaluate Options

**Research Actions:**

1. **Leverage existing research (if found in Step 1):**
   - Use `view_file` to review research documents
   - Extract key insights, alternatives, and recommendations
   - Identify gaps needing additional investigation

2. **Conduct additional web research:**
   - Use `search_web` for:
     - "[technology/pattern] architectural approaches"
     - "[decision area] best practices"
     - "[technology] vs [alternative] comparison"
     - "[pattern] pros and cons"

3. **Use `codebase_search` to understand current implementation**

4. **Document alternative options:**
   - Current state/status quo option
   - Industry standard approaches
   - Innovative or emerging alternatives
   - Hybrid approaches

**Evaluation Framework:**
For each alternative, evaluate:
- Technical feasibility and complexity
- Performance and scalability implications
- Security and compliance considerations
- Development effort and timeline
- Long-term maintenance and evolution
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Step 5: Document ADR with Decision Rationale

**Preparation:**

1. **Get current date:**
   ```bash
   date +%Y-%m-%d
   ```

2. **Determine ADR number:**
   - Check existing ADRs in `.code-captain/decision-records/`
   - Use sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.)

3. **Create ADR using `write_to_file`:**

4. **After completion, create memory of the decision:**
   Ask Cascade: "Please create a memory of this architectural decision: [brief summary of the chosen option and key rationale]"

## Best Practices

### Decision Scope and Focus
- Focus on one significant architectural decision per ADR
- Clearly separate problem from potential solutions
- Include sufficient context for future readers
- Document decision even if it seems obvious
- Consider both technical and business implications

### Alternatives Analysis
- Always include "do nothing" or "status quo" option
- Research industry standards and best practices
- Consider short-term and long-term implications
- Include effort and risk assessments for each option
- Seek diverse perspectives and expert opinions

### Decision Documentation
- Use clear, jargon-free language for new team members
- Include relevant diagrams, code examples, or architectural sketches
- Reference external sources and supporting documentation
- Document both positive and negative consequences honestly
- Plan for decision review and potential revision

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Involve all teams affected by architectural decision
- Allow time for thoughtful review and feedback
- Document dissenting opinions and how they were addressed
- Ensure decision makers have sufficient context and time
- Follow up on implementation and measure success

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Rushing to document without proper analysis
- Making decisions without stakeholder input
