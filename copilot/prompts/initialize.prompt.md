# Initialize Command

## Overview

Analyze and set up technical foundation for either greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing) projects. This command intelligently detects project type, scans the codebase, and generates foundational documentation including technology stack analysis, code style guide, and architectural overview.

## Command Process

### Step 1: Project Type Detection

**Scan for existing code:**
- Check for common files indicating existing project (package.json, pom.xml, etc.)
- Detect programming languages and frameworks
- Identify project structure patterns
- Determine if greenfield (new) or brownfield (existing) project

### Step 2: Project Analysis

**For Brownfield Projects:**
- Scan codebase for technology stack inventory
- Analyze code patterns and conventions
- Infer project purpose and goals
- Generate comprehensive documentation

**For Greenfield Projects:**
- Guide through strategic project setup questions
- Recommend technology stack based on requirements
- Create project foundation structure

### Step 3: Documentation Generation

Generate foundational documents in `.code-captain/docs/`:

**tech-stack.md** - Complete technology inventory and analysis
**code-style.md** - Observed patterns and coding conventions  
**objective.md** - Inferred or defined project purpose and goals
**architecture.md** - System architecture overview and decisions

### Step 4: Next Steps Recommendation

Provide clear guidance on next steps, typically:
1. **`/plan-product`** - For product strategy and vision planning
2. **`/create-spec`** - For specific feature development
3. **`/research`** - For technology investigation needs

## Tool Integration

**Primary tools:**
- `codebase` - Analyzing codebase patterns and structure
- `search` - Finding specific patterns and technologies
- `editFiles` - Creating foundational documentation
- `runCommands` - Detecting build tools and dependencies
- `githubRepo` - Understanding repository context and history
- `findTestFiles` - Locating test files and patterns
- `problems` - Identifying code issues

**Documentation organization:**
- Progress documented in `.code-captain/initialization-progress.md`
- Results organized in `.code-captain/docs/` folder

This command provides comprehensive project analysis and setup using GitHub Copilot's native capabilities.
